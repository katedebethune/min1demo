      <h1>CSCI E-3 Unit 4 Project</h1>
      <p class="whatlearn">The Unit 4 Project will give you a chance to exercise
        your knowledge of extending jQuery and of multimedia players like the
        JWPlayer.&nbsp; We're building on the "divide-text-into-spans" example
        we started in Project #3A, and will finish this with a fully-working
        example. &nbsp; </p>
      <h4><br>
        <em>You will use jQuery and JWPlayer to add a video to this page, and
          make the transcript interactive with the video. The file at
          js/transcript.js has a framework "stubbed out" with a few key code
          segments&nbsp; for you to fill in.&nbsp; <br>
        </em></h4>
      At the bottom of this page is a block of text which is the transcript from
      a public-domain video produced by NASA. (Sorry for the hokey video&mdash;I
      needed something in the public domain, brief, and for which there was a timed
      transcript available).&nbsp; If you look at the source code, you'll see
      that this seemingly single block of text is actually broken up into many
      separate SPANs, similar to the ones you made in Unit Project #3A.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The HTML source code looks something like this:<br>
      <blockquote><span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span class="words"
          data-start="17.869" data-dur="3.82"&gt;Hey this is Dwayne Johnson.
          While playing astronaut Chuck Baker in the film Planet&lt;/span&gt;<br>
          &lt;span class="words" data-start="21.689"
          data-dur="0.701"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;<br>
          &lt;span class="words" data-start="22.39" data-dur="3.56"&gt;I gained
          a lot of respect for our nation's space program. NASA makes
          new&lt;/span&gt;</span></blockquote>
      The code in the js/transcript.js file provides the framework for the
      solution which is a jQuery plugin called 'playerConnect()'.&nbsp; In
      usage, it looks like this: <span style="font-family: monospace;">$('.words').playerConnect(player);</span>,
      where the jQuery selector is returning the collection of SPAN elements,
      and player is the jwplayer instance we've added to the page.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The resulting behavior is twofold:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>As the video plays, the relevant part of the transcript highlights.
        </li>
        <li>If the user clicks on the transcript, the video seeks to the
          relevant segment.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A video showing the desired behavior is <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/315/assignments/2065">on
          the assignment page in Canvas</a>.</p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      Much of the code is provided for you in a well-commented framework, but
      the solution will require you to add code in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">four</span>
      three places, each marked by a comment line like this: "YOUR CODE TO ADD #<em>n</em>":<br>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">YOUR CODE TO ADD #1: </span>The
          first one is near the end of the JS file, where you'll create the
          jwplayer and load it into the page <em>(this one is already done for
            you ... you're welcome!)</em></li>
        <li>YOUR CODE TO ADD #2: Next you'll move into the jQuery plugin itself,
          where you'll get the current position of the video playback from the
          jwplayer's event object</li>
        <li>YOUR CODE TO ADD #3: Third, you'll write the loop that compares the
          current player time with the time described in each element, and apply
          a style if the times match up.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>YOUR CODE TO ADD #4: Finally, the click handler for each element is
          created, but the logic inside is missing. You'll add the code that
          causes a click to make the player seek to the right moment.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If this sounds scary, don't despair!&nbsp; The code already includes
        most of the heavy lifting, detailed instructions, and pseudo-code is
        provided in several places. </p>
      <p>We will cover JWPlayer in Week 13 in great detail and walk
        through some examples very similar to this one.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As usual, submit your project as a zip file, with a folder named like
        [lastname_firstname].project4 zipped into a file called
        [lastname_firstname].project4.zip. </p>
